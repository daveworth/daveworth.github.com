title: 'Close your rings with Jiu Jitsu'

A couple of years ago a few things happened: I bought an Apple Watch, I started training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ), and I got frustrated that I couldn't close my rings even when I ended every night of training in a puddle of sweat, sore, and wanting to train more.  Last year I joined Strava, met our device expert, and a few months ago I finally achieved my goal of measuring my daily roles.  (_Note_: any and all opinions expressed here are mine and do not represent Strava in any way.)

The tl;dr; - [Polar OH1(+)](https://www.polar.com/us-en/products/accessories/oh1-optical-heart-rate-sensor) heart-rate monitor (HRM) worn under the rash guard with the sensor and plastic strap bits between my arm and torso, Polar Beat linked to Strava, Strava linked to Apple - Magic ring closing.

Before we dig into the devices or the connections let's talk about the problem space a bit.  Recently over coffee a stranger really challenged me on the base concept of measuring my Jiu Jitsu.  Running and Cycling on Strava are well understood on Strava - they have a bunch of data: location and via GPS (and possibly via bike computer), heart-rate, possibly power on the bike.  And Strava is really well tuned for these use-cases, and are constantly building new experiences for other sports.  So how did I intend to measure BJJ?  I would love to use my Apple watch but I would not love to injure a partner with the watch or the band when they get fingers stuck in it.  The best first idea I had was heart rate via an external heart rate monitor..

Another reasonable question is "why are you even doing this?  Does closing your rings matter?" It probably doesn't but for some reason I care.  In many ways I like the "closing of your rings" concept - it inspires continual improvement.  I used Strava as a training log for cycling when I returned to the sport years ago, and now I want the same for BJJ.  By using Strava for this I also have a training log to track my daily work and accomplishments - interspersed with my friends running, cycling, and other activities.

When first pursuing measurement, heart rate was obvious to me.  I've been wearing HRMs for a very long time but most of them have a hard plastic sensor in the middle of the strap, directly over my sternum.  All I could imagine was a hard plastic sensor shaped bruise on my sternum from a shoulder during a pass - no thanks!  In my research I could not find a single HRM that met my needs.  I stared having crazy ideas - maybe I could hide one under a wrestling scoring strap?  Maybe I could pad it with neoprene?  Maybe I would have to build my own!  [Bitalino](https://bitalino.com/) has [this kit](https://bitalino.com/en/plugged-kit-bt) with all sorts of sensors!

*I am not a maker.*

Luckily I was spared from this madness when the device guru at work was in town and I mentioned my idea - the Polar OH1(+) (linked above the fold)!  The good news - it just works.  The bad news - figuring out how it just works took a bit of hilarious experimentation but I have a protocol now!  Yay.

_Note_ there are other devices that probably work just as well.  For example the Scosche armband may be just fine.  Under the rash guard should be good as well.  I have training partners who use it, bring their phone onto the mats, and record that way.  Last time I checked they are not trying to link to Strava or Apple.

## The Protocol

Step 0: Prepare

Download the Polar Beat and Strava apps onto your iPhone. Create both Strava and Polar accounts.

Login to [Polar's Flow site](https://flow.polar.com/) and [connect to Strava](https://support.polar.com/us-en/support/how_can_i_automatically_sync_my_data_from_polar_flow_to_strava) via Settings -> Profile.

On your device ensure that Strava is [connected to Health App](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216917527-Health-App-Integration?page=4).

These last connections steps can be left until you get a hang of the Recording and Uploading to Polar steps below otherwise you may get some surprise accidental activities.  I did and got kudos for 33s of sitting at my desk.

Step 1: *Record*

This sounds really obvious but getting it right takes a little work.  The OH1 has two modes - a broadcast mode where the Polar Beat app records.  The app itself supports a ton of activity types and, by default, wires into Polar's social network: Flow.  The second mode, and my preference so that I'm not dragging my phone around the mat, is to record independently and upload later - that is our goal.

To enable recording turn on the OH1 (press and hold until the LED and sensors turn green).  Then press the only button twice quickly to enable recording mode.  The key here is *TWO BLINKS*  _not_ one blink, every couple of seconds.  Secondly - two white blinks means it has not picked up your heart rate yet, two green blinks means it is sensing your heart rate.  For this reason I wear the monitor with the LED facing my head so I can see that it is recording correctly before I get on the mat.

Step 2: *Upload*

When you're done training press and hold the button until the device turns off.  Open Polar Beat on your phone and turn your OH1 back on.  A few seconds later a spinning disk will drop into the upper left hand side to show the upload progress.  If you are linked to Strava at this point, and Strava is allowed to push notifications to you, you will shortly received a push notification alerting you that your application is ready.

Step 2a: *Update your rings*

Edit your activity in Strava.  This is anecdotally required to update your rings on your Apple Watch.

Step 3: *Congrats*

You are now recording your Jiu Jitsu and getting "points" e.g. your rings represent the effort you were already expending.  I also like to treat the Strava Activity as a training log so I add a "clever" name for the activity (generally a dad joke), and a quick note of what we did in class and with whom I trained in the description.  YMMV
