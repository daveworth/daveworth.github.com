After posting my [first](/2012/12/25/coffee-setups-for-the-persnikkity.html)
blog post on my newly created,
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)-powered, GitHub page, where I
concluded said post with a question, a friend quite rightfully pointed out that
I had no means of contact to ask a question.  He suggested
[Disqus](http://disqus.com/), or just posting my Twitter name. I jokingly
suggested using GitHub issues and then realized it might just work.  The general
target audience of my posts will likely already have GitHub accounts so I am not
too concerned about another account being used by readers.  Since crazier things
have happened I've decided to do just that.

What do you think?  Could it work?  Let me know how you feel by opening an Issue
by clicking the link in the footer.
