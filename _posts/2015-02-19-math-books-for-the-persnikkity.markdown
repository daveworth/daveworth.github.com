I am lucky enough to work with a math-enthusiastic bunch of folks.  We often
talk about great papers and books for the student of Math.  Here's my list of my
favorite books from my graduate school days.

<!-- -**-END-**- -->

So often subjects blend that I am not going to do the usual
Algebra/Analysis/Topology/etc. breakdown.  Is Linear Algebra algebra or
analysis?  How can you tell in functional analysis or harmonic analysis?  I
can't so I won't even try!  Instead I am grouping them "thematically" e.g. the
way I see them fitting well together!  I am only listing the exceptional books
here as there are lots of books we know as classics and the list will be
identical to all of those - Baby Rudin!  Lang or Hungerford's Algebra!  Alfor's
Complex Analysis!

Moreover, I am linking to publisher sites rather than big vendors.  You are
fully capable of finding sellers.

* [Linear Algebra Done Right](http://linear.axler.net/) by Sheldon Axler.  This
  book basically punts on determinants and instead talks about the properties of
  operators!
* [Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces](http://www.springer.com/mathematics/algebra/book/978-0-387-90093-3)
  by Paul Halmos.  Some of the clearest and most elegant prose giving intuition to linear algebra I have ever read.
* [A First Course in Wavelets with Fourier Analysis](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470431172.html)
  by Albert Boggess and Francis J. Narcowich.  A great and comprehensible
  introduction to Fourier Analysis leading into a gentle building of wavelet
  theory.
* [Fourier Analysis](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7562.html) -
  An Introduction by Elias M. Stein &amp; Rami Shakarachi.  For focussed
  and gentle discussion of Fourier Analysis I have never found a clearer
  explanation than this book.
* [Measure and Integration Theory](http://www.degruyter.com/view/product/174435)
  by Heinz Bauer.  Measure theory is pretty dry but so critical.  Bauer's
  exposition is concise, to the point, and builds the theory from foundations in
  such a way as to never leave difficult gaps.
* [Beginning Functional Analysis](http://www.springer.com/mathematics/analysis/book/978-0-387-95224-6)
  by Karen Saxe.  So many Functional Analysis books are built in exactly the
  same way around linear algebra and functionals and duals but Saxe gets you
  there with extreme grace.

* [Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms](http://www.springer.com/mathematics/algebra/book/978-0-387-35650-1) -
  An Introduction to Computational Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra
  by David Cox, John Little, and Donal O'Shea.  I am not an algebraist by any
  stretch of the imagination but this book is such a nice introduction to
  commutative algebra that everyone should read and play with it at least once.

* [Weighing the Odds](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/statistics-probability/statistical-theory-and-methods/weighing-odds-course-probability-and-statistics) -
  A course in Probability and Statistics by David Williams.  A course in
  probability that does not simply jump into Expectation and Distributions but
  instead wants to lend intuition to the process.
