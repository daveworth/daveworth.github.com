Since I work with a bunch of people who care about quality, and also about
coffee, and since I am definitely one of them, a couple of times I've been asked
about what tools I would recommend to build your home coffee paradise.

<!-- -**-END-**- -->

## Pour over

My recommendation for the home coffee enthusiast is 100% in the pour-over camp.
There are lots of variations, the equipment is inexpensive, and the results are
super nuanced and can be fun to tinker with.

The basic equipment needed are

* Your favorite coffee mug
* Some pour-over vessel _and_ appropriate filters
* Something to pour hot water with
* Some coffee beans (ground)

### Vessels
The two basic pour-over vessel types are a Chemex and a "single-cup" vessel.
Both are fantastic and produce great results with slightly different technique.
There are also "hybrid" devices such as the [Clever Coffee
Dripper](http://www.sweetmarias.com/clevercoffeedripperpictorial.php) which is
apparently fantastic but I haven't had the chance to experiment.  If you are
opting into the [Chemex](http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/) camp, there are
various sizes of brewers so choose the style and size you prefer.  This will not
affect the quality of your coffee.

If you are choosing the "single-cup" variety I really like the [Hario V60](http://www.sweetmarias.com/sweetmarias/coffee-brewers/filtercones/hario-v60-ceramic-drip-cone.html) and the
[Bee House Ceramic
Dripper](http://www.sweetmarias.com/sweetmarias/coffee-brewers/filtercones/beehouse-dripper-large.html).
The latter has a couple of advantages in that the "windows" at the base of the
dripper allow you to see relative volumes of coffee to that which your mug will
contain (yes.. you can weigh your water, I don't, maybe I should, but I still
like the visual feedback) _and_ its holes are smaller so it is easier to dial in
your process than with the V60.  That said, I've had fantastic luck with the V60
after taking the time to dial in my process and am very happy with it.

### Filters
As important as your vessel are your filters.  The Chemex filters are the gold
standard of quality across the board.  I recommend _against_ [The
Kone](http://ablebrewing.com/products/kone-coffee-filter) as reports are that
the "clean cup" of the Chemex is immediately undone by this, admittedly sexy,
devise.  Use paper filters.  Since we're on the subject, a recent taste-test of
unbleached vs. bleached filters showed the latter to be _significantly_ better
e.g. they do not contribute a strong paper taste to the coffee.  I was shocked,
as a complete disbeliever, that such a strong taste could be contributed by the
unbleached filters but it was clear as day.  Chemex has a nice
[selection](http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/products/filters.html), though I 
have ever only used the square variety.If you are using the Hario V60, I
highly recommend [their filters](http://www.sweetmarias.com/sweetmarias/hario-v-shaped-filters-pack-of-40.html)
as they do not contribute any paper flavor and work perfectly with their vessel.
For the Bee House vessel a standard #2 or #4 filter will work perfectly (with
the latter extending over the top of the vessel), and [Sweet Marias](http://www.sweetmarias.com)
, a reputable vendor of awesome coffee gear, recommends [these](http://www.sweetmarias.com/sweetmarias/coffee-brewers/filters/filtropa-4-filters-white.html).

### Kettles
To pour your water over your coffee a simple measuring cup (with a nice
beak-shaped pour spout) or a steaming filter _can_ be used but the results were
tedious in my experience.  Instead I recommend dropping the little but of change
and using a proper goose-neck kettle.  (This is exactly the point where you
should feel a little dorky.)  The Hario
[Buono](http://www.amazon.com/Hario-VKB-120HSV-Buono-Drip-Kettle/dp/B000IGOXLS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1352914801&sr=8-2)
is probably the best known though the
[Bonavita](http://www.amazon.com/Bonavita-BV3825ST-1-Liter-Stovetop-Kettle/dp/B005YR0IBU/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1352914967&sr=1-2)
is a fantastic deal and even has an [electric version](http://www.amazon.com/Bonavita-1-0L-Electric-Kettle-BV3825B/dp/B005YR0GDA/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1356474791&sr=1-1)
and even a [temperature controlled version](http://www.amazon.com/Bonavita-Variable-Temperature-Electric-Gooseneck/dp/B005YR0F40/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1356474791&sr=1-2).

### Grinders

As much as we don't want to admit it, grinders are as important to the brewing
process as anything else.  The #1 most important quality in a grinder, above all
else, is consistency.  Speed, expense, etc. are all secondary to consistency,
and by consistency, I mean how consistent the size of grind being produced is.
There are very expensive machines that do a great job but for a home users the
[Baratza Virtuoso](http://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Virtuoso-Coffee-Grinder-586/dp/B006MLQHRG/ref=sr_1_3?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1352914994&sr=1-3)
is my pick.  Recently I was taken away from my Baratza and was exposed to the
very stylish [Bodum Bistro](http://www.amazon.com/Bodum-Bistro-Electric-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B0043095WW),
which to its credit, was a very very good grinder.  The Bodum's granularity of
grind was much less than the Baratzas, but clearly the prior produced a grind of
such quality as to warrant a mention here.

If you are a particularly manual individual Hario makes a pair of fantastic
hand-grinders in the
[Skeron](http://www.amazon.com/Hario-Coffee-Hand-Grinder-Skerton/dp/B001802PIQ)
and the
[Mini](http://www.amazon.com/Hario-MSS-1B-Mini-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B001804CLY/ref=pd_sbs_k_2).
Even if you have one of the above home grinders these are perfect, along with a
simple pour-over vessel for a travel setup.

### Accoutrements

You may prefer to put your "single-cup" pour-over vessel onto something other
than your mug.  My home setup includes a [chemistry
ring-stand](http://www.hometrainingtools.com/ring-stand-4x6-base-18-rod/p/CE-STAND2/) 
(and [support](http://www.hometrainingtools.com/ring-support-4-diameter/p/CE-RING4/)).
That particular setup is a bit particular as the ring support extends over the
bevel on the base meaning there is a bit of a balancing act, perhaps replacing
the base or finding another stand is the key.  If you're into that whole
chemistry theme a [400ml beaker](http://www.hometrainingtools.com/beaker-glass-400-ml/p/CE-BEI0400/)
makes an excellent post-extraction drip catcher to go with your ring stand,
and a [beaker-mug](http://www.hometrainingtools.com/glass-beaker-mug-400-ml/p/CE-BMUG400/)
completes the motif.

Another pretty great tool for dialing in your process is [Intelligensia Coffee](http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/)'s
[iPhone App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/intelligentsia-coffee/id404497566?mt=8).
I discovered it by scanning their random QRCode at a store carrying them but am
very glad I did.  The app itself has information about their coffees,
instructions on various brewing techniques, and includes a timer for many
preparation styles, with various timed steps along the way.  For example, the
pour-over timer provides for a 45-second bloom followed by two minutes of brew
time.  By strictly following the times in the app I was able to adjust my grind
and my pour-over technique to make it very consistent.  From there,
experimentation was key.  I highly recommend using this app, or another timer,
in order to dial in the process at some point.  The brewing instructions in the
application also provide details on water weight/volume as appropriate by
brewing technique, which is perfect if you are even more persnikkity than I am.

## Espresso

Firstly, I do not recommend someone who really cares about coffee get an
espresso machine for home unless money is not an issue.  I don't like full auto
machines and would recommend a semi-auto, or if you're a real dork, maybe a
lever machine (though lever espresso and pump-machine espresso are as different
as IPA and Westvletteren and probably shouldn't be discussed simultaneously).
If you can spend as much as you like the following machines are my
recommendations:

* [La Marzocco GS3](http://www.lamarzocco.com/index.php?lang=en&Itemid=484) (Either is fine but the Paddle Edition is amazing)
* Anything with an E61 Group and a PID will do you well probably.  I personally
  love the [Rocket](http://www.rocket-espresso.it/domestic/) or the [Quick Mill
  Vetrano](http://www.quickmill.it/MyIndex.php?Lang=ENG&Menu=Prodotto&id_prod=75)
* If you want to dork out and hack your espresso machine the [Rancilio Silvia]() is
  the [Arduino]() of the coffee world.  Go for it.

And, just as the grinder is critical for great pour-over, so too is it critical
for espresso.  The default go-to grinder for someone serious at home is the
[Mazzer Mini](http://www.chriscoffee.com/products/home/grinders/mazzer_mini_electronic_espresso_grinder)
(I _think_ I prefer the doserless option but a doser might be fine too).  If
you've opted for the Rancilio Silvia above then you may also really dig the
[Rancilio Rocky](http://www.wholelattelove.com/Rancilio/rockyracilio.cfm)
grinder which is its matching sister.

What gear am I missing?!  I'm sure there's tons and would love your insight!
